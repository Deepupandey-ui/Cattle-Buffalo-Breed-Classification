 Cattle-Buffalo-Breed-Classification

 This project is made by TEAM- "NETRA".
Our idea is to build an 'AI tool' that can detect cattle and buffalo breeds from images.

✨ What this project does
- Takes an image of cattle/buffalo
- Uses **AI (YOLOv8 + OpenCV)** to identify the breed
- Measures body structure from the image
- Creates an instant **PDF report** that farmers can use in the field

🛠️ Tools & Tech We Use
- 'Python' – Main programming language  
- 'Streamlit' – To make a simple web app  
- 'OpenCV + scikit-image' – For image processing  
- 'YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)'– For breed detection  
- 'Google Colab' – For training AI model  
- 'Roboflow + Kaggle' – For datasets
  
🌍 Why this is useful
'Farmers' → Helps them quickly know the breed
'Wildlife & Conservation' → Non-invasive animal tracking
'Education'→ Teaches about animal welfare
It saves time, reduces errors, and improves animal care.
